=== Setup with CircleCI orb
----
module "service_documentation" {
  source                      = "github.com/nsbno/servicedocumentation//modules/plain-servicedoc"
  application_name            = "${local.name_prefix}-${local.application_name}"
  env                         = local.environment
  current_account_id          = data.aws_caller_identity.this.account_id
  slack                       = "#team-kanalname"
  owner                       = "budgetowner@vy.no"
  technicalowner              = "tekniskowner@vy.no"
  servicesla                  = "99.7"
  growthmetric                = "transaction count"
  aktivitetskode              = "123456"
}
----

Using CircleCI orb approach is recommended as this would autoupdate openapi files through pipeline upon application changes

=== Setup without CircleCI orb
[source,hcl]
----
module "service_documentation" {
  source                      = "github.com/nsbno/servicedocumentation//modules/api-gateway"
  name_prefix                 = local.name_prefix
  env                         = local.environment
  current_account_id          = data.aws_caller_identity.this.account_id
  slack                       = "#team-kanalname"
  owner                       = "budgetowner@vy.no"
  technicalowner              = "tekniskowner@vy.no"
  servicesla                  = "99.7"
  growthmetric                = "transaction count"
  aktivitetskode              = "123456"
  api_gateway_id              = module.api_gateway.rest_api_id
}
----

This apporach do not auto update openapi files unless an attribute value for the module is updated
